# C++ implementation of Game Go. Code provided for the university project with some pieces predefined and ready to use. Go is a strategic board game played on a 19x19 grid (or smaller sizes for beginners). Two players, Black and White, take turns placing stones on the intersections of the board. The goal is to control more territory than your opponent by surrounding empty spaces. You can also capture your opponent's stones by completely surrounding them. The game ends when both players pass their turns, and the player with the most territory and captured stones wins.
